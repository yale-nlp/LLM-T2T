Your task is to provide 5 different consistent claims derived from a table according to the given corresponding logical labels. Consistent means that all information of your claims should be supported by the corresponding table. There are 9 kinds of logical labels in total, which are "aggregation", "negation", "superlative", "count", "comparative", "ordinal", "unique" , "all" and "none". The detailed explanation of these logical type labels are shown as follows. Provided 5 claims should be different from each other.

1. aggregation: the aggregation operation refers to sentences like "the averaged age of all ....", "the total amount of scores obtained in ...", etc.
2. negation: the negation operation refers to sentences like "xxx did not get the best score", "xxx has never obtained a score higher than 5".
3. superlative: the superlative operation refers to sentences like "xxx achieves the highest score in", "xxx is the lowest player in the team".
4. count: the count operation refers to sentences like "there are 3 xxx from xxx country in the game".
5. comparative: the comparative operation refers to sentences like "xxx has a higher score than yyy".
6. ordinal: the ordinal operation refers to sentences like "the first country to achieve xxx is xxx", "xxx is the second oldest person in the country".
7. unique: the unique operation refers to sentences like "there are 5 different nations in the tournament, ", "there are no two different players from U.S"
8. all: the for all operation refers to sentences like "all of the trains are departing in the morning", "none of the people are older than 25."
9. none: the sentences which do not involve higher-order operations like "xxx achieves 2 points in xxx game", "xxx player is from xxx country".

To guide your responses, we have provided one example table with five claims. Use the template to structure your answer, provide reasoning for your claims and suggest claims. We encourage you to think through each step of the process carefully.


Example 1:
Title: 1941 vfl season
Table:
home team | home team score | away team | away team score | venue | crowd | date
richmond | 10.13 (73) | st kilda | 6.11 (47) | punt road oval | 6000 | 21 june 1941
hawthorn | 6.8 (44) | melbourne | 12.12 (84) | glenferrie oval | 2000 | 21 june 1941
collingwood | 8.12 (60) | essendon | 7.10 (52) | victoria park | 6000 | 21 june 1941
carlton | 10.17 (77) | fitzroy | 12.13 (85) | princes park | 4000 | 21 june 1941
south melbourne | 8.16 (64) | north melbourne | 6.6 (42) | lake oval | 5000 | 21 june 1941
geelong | 10.18 (78) | footscray | 13.15 (93) | kardinia park | 5000 | 21 june 1941

Logical label 1: superlative
Logical label 2: superlative
Logical label 3: count
Logical label 4: comparative
Logical label 5: all

Reasoning 1: looking at both "home team score" column and "away team score" column, finding the highest score was 13.15 (93) in "away team score" column and then looking for which team scored 13.15 (93) in "away team" colmun, footscray scored the most point of any team that played on 21 june.
Claim 1: footscray scored the most point of any team that played on 21 june, 1941.

Reasoning 2: looking at "home team" column and finding the corresponding home team scores of geelong in "home team score" column, geelong did have the highest score.
Claim 2: geelong was the home team with the highest score.

Reasoning 3: looking at "venue" column, there were six venues in total and kardinia park was the one of six venues.
Claim 3: kardinia park was the one of the six venues that were put to use.

Reasoning 4: looking at "away team" column and finding the corresponding away team scores of north melbourne and melbourne in "away team score" column, north melbourne as away team scored 6.6 (42) while melbourne as away team scored 12.12 (84).
Claim 4: north melbourne away team recorded an away score of 6.6 (42) while melbourne recorded an away score of 12.12 (84).

Reasoning 5: looking at "date" column, all six matches took place on 21 june 1941.
Claim 5: all six matches took place on 21 june 1941.


Now please give 5 different consistent claims of the new table. Let's think step by step and follow the template of the example.
